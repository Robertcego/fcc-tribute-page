            <p>Darrell Lance Abbott (August 20, 1966 – December 8, 2004), best known by his stage name
              Dimebag Darrell,
              was an American musician and songwriter. He was the guitarist of the heavy metal bands Pantera and
              Damageplan, both of which he co-founded alongside his brother Vinnie Paul. He was one of the driving
              forces behind the development of groove metal, and is considered one of the most influential guitarists
              in
              heavy metal history.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="p2">
            <p>A son of country music producer Jerry Abbott, Abbott began playing guitar at age 12, and
              Pantera
              released its debut album, Metal Magic (1983), when he was 16. Originally a glam metal musician, Abbott
              went by the stage name Diamond Darrell at the time. Two further albums in the glam metal style followed
              in 1984 and 1985, before original vocalist Terry Glaze was replaced by Phil Anselmo in 1986 and Power
              Metal (1988) was released. The band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990), introduced a groove
              metal sound to which Abbott's guitar playing was central. This sound was refined on Vulgar Display of
              Power (1992), and the group's third major-label record, Far Beyond Driven, debuted at No. 1 on the
              Billboard 200 in 1994.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="p3">
            <p>Tensions within Pantera reduced its output after the release of The Great Southern Trendkill
              in 1996,
              and Reinventing the Steel (2000) was the band's final studio album before its acrimonious separation
              in 2003. Abbott subsequently formed Damageplan with his brother Vinnie Paul and released New Found
              Power, the band's debut and only album, in 2004. Other works by Abbott included a collaboration with
              David Allan Coe titled Rebel Meets Rebel (2006) and numerous guest guitar solos for bands such as
              Anthrax. Abbott was shot and killed by a deranged fan on December 8, 2004, while on stage with
              Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. Three others were murdered in the shooting
              before the perpetrator was killed by police.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="p4">
            <p>Abbott was ranked at No. 92 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All
              Time" in
              2011, and No. 19 on Louder's list of "The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" in 2018. He placed at
              No. 5 on Gibson's list of "The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time" in 2015, and the same year was
              ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by VH1.</p>

            <blockquote class="dime-quote">As a kid it was always my dream to be with Dean guitars, to play a Dean
              guitar – to own one
              some day. And funny enough, how this whole thing evolved, after countless days of skipping school and
              gawking at the Dean catalog, learning inside and out everything about it, and dreaming it would happen
              some day. There was a guitar contest that came to town, and the a prize was the Dean ML guitar, and at
              the same time – I didn’t know, my dad ordered me a cherry burst Dean ML Standard. The day when that
              thing came in was the night of the contest – and I won it! That was the best day of my life. I won the
              guitar, and my dad got me a bad-ass fu**ing Dean standard.</blockquote>
